Welcome to Cython Orbital Builder's documentation!
==================================================

Introduction
------------

Cython Orbital Builder (CyOB) is a python module created in order to help students and teachers in the field of inorganic chemistry 
to perform quantum chemical calculations and visualize its results. 
CyOB uses two readily available packages (PyQInt and PyTessel) with a C++ backbone, which highly increases calculation speed.
CyOB is made with user friendliness in mind. The only thing the user has to do is to create a small input script (which can be found on 
the :ref:`input` page) and to call CyOB. If the user reads and follows this documentation carefully, hardly any difficulties should be found.
