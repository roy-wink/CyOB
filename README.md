# Purpose
Cython orbital builder (CyOB) is a python package (module) for easily calculating and visualizing molecular orbitals.

# Prerequisites
CyOB works in a Spyder environment. Spyder can be downloaded via the Anaconda website.

One needs to install the PyQInt and PyTessel packages via:

```
conda install -c ifilot pyqint
conda install -c ifilot pytessel
```

# Installation
CyOB can be installed via the Spyder console:

```
conda install -c rwink cyob
```

# Excecution and more information
Check the CyOB documentation via ... for all important information.

# Changelog version 0.2
In version 0.2, the possibility was added to export energies of the molecular orbitals and the entire system.
Furthermore, more user-friendlyness was added in the event there is a mistake in the input file. Now, CyOB check whether all functionalities are present. Also, redundant input exits excecution, instead of simply being discarded.
Finally, the documentation was addapted accordingly and spelling errors were fixed. Also, the beta-testers got their name on the appropriate place.
